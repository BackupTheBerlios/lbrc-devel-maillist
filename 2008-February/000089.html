<PRE>Hey,

&gt;<i> one thing i figured out is, when the connection is lost between the
</I>&gt;<i> devices, the j2me application on my se k750i hangs and i have to power
</I>&gt;<i> off my phone to get rid of it...
</I>&gt;<i> maybe there's a way to kind of &quot;park &quot; the logical connection on lost of
</I>&gt;<i> physical connection or something, or at least disconnect properly.
</I>
this is very strange. This is part of the j2me bluetooth layer. What
basicly happens is this:

1. RFCOMM Port is openend on server
2. j2me part creates a connection to this port
3a. The server part uses asynchronous-IO (whether this is done in kernel
space or on the gobject layer I don't know - and we don't have to care
as it doesn't change anything)
3b. The j2me part uses two threads - thread one listens on the created
streamreader and blocks when there is nothing to read. The other thread
handles the sending part and the display and keypress part
4. When the connection is shut down - either side can close the socket
connection. Then
5a. gobject signals this with a special event mask and an empty read =&gt;
when this happens we shut down the pc side
5b. the j2me part should notice the shutdown, currently by to
conditions. The first: We get notified, that the read call succeeded,
but nothing was read (this is the documented behaviour). The second:
Nokia seems to raise an IOException instead. We catch that and exit
gracefully. See LBRCSender.java for this.

Then there is the question - how is your connection lost. I tested the
connection through concrete laced with steel (not sure whether this is
the right term for the german &quot;Stahlbeton&quot;). I noticed, that the RFCOMM
stack tries for some time (for me this was something in the range of
15-30s) to send again and again. But at some time the connection should
be torn down and this should(!) be signaled by an empty read.

This should happen regardless, whether the connection was broken
intentionally (either on server or on client side) or whether it was an
accident. The only thing were I could really change something is when
the connection is intentionally closed.

I can't &quot;park&quot; the connection, as this is dealt with on a layer I have
no further control over (j2me bluetooth experts come forward if I've
overlooked something).

You could implement the connection on a lower layer, where you would
have to deal with connection states, data delivery and integrety and so
forth your self. I'm not sure whether it's worth it. And it could be,
that the access to these layers is blocked by j2me security settings.
This gets very fast very messy.

Greetings

Matthias
