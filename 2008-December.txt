Subject: [Lbrc-devel] Release of LBRC 0.6.4
Message-ID: <1230493586.12731.2.camel@enterprise.glx>

Hey everyone,

earlier today I released the 0.6.4 version of LBRC. It was more or less
ready on the twelfth of December. Since then my notebook broke, my qemu
build environment failed and some personal things had to be dealt with.

Nothing big to say, other than that it should now work on ubuntu 8.10
with the new bluez release.

Greetings

Matthias
