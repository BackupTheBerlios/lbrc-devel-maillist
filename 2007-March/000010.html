<PRE>Hey,

Iuri feel free to take the profile editor, I'll stay away from it, till
I hear from you.

Ok, I used glade to build the mockup, because this was the tool to get
the basic layout out. I also think glade would be a sensible tool to get
the job done. As far as I understood it from the discussions, there is
and should no code generator anymore.

I try to drop as many dependencies as possible, but I would expect
nearly every distribution to also ship python-glade2 bindings.
(python-dbus seems to be bit more exotic at least at this point in time)

To bring this to an end: I would be happy whether you choose to code the
gui directly in python or choose to use glade.

&gt;<i> 2) I have looked all code and there's no support (yet) for hot

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the question 2, I think that adding necessary support is the best
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do.
</I>
I second that. But it need support in UinputDispatcher, as the Events,
that will be send to the uinput device have to registered, when it is
opened. Currently the code scans all profiles and based on that it
creates the necessary event masks. I think the most sensible way to
solve that, is setting the event masks for all mouse and keyboard
related events. Then it's just a matter of triggering a reload of the
profile files in the dbus component. So basicly I would propose, that
the profile editor creates a new profile.conf file in the appropriate
place and then calls a dbus method (that has to established), that
triggers a reload of the profiles.

Greetings


Matthias
