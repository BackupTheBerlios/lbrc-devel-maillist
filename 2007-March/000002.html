<PRE>Hey again,

some comments on the current structure of LBRC:

/LBRC/__init__.py
=================
Contains necessary functions to retrieve data-, config- and binary file
locations. These functions where introduced to handle the installation
into a systemwide directory and also enabling to run it from the devel
directory.

/LBRC/consts.py
===============
Contains the necessary constants to create the uinput device. These are
essentially adaptions of input.h and uinput.h taken from the kernel
source, which can be found in the doc directory

/LBRC/BTServer.py
=================
Responsible for the handling of the bluetooth connection. It receives
the keycodes from the j2me part and decodes them. The distribution of
the received keycodes is done via gobject signals. 

/LBRC/dbusinterface.py
======================
The main structure can be found here. Here the BTServer is instantiated,
a gobject main loop is started, the dbusinterface established and this
module servers as the dispatcher of the keycodes to the following
(currently) two modules. This module also reads the configfile
(config.conf) and the profiles file(s) (profile.conf) and passes them to
the modules, that need this information.

/LBRC/CommandExecutor.py
========================
Handles entries in the profiles of the form:

{&quot;keycode&quot;: &quot;&lt;code&gt;&quot;, &quot;mapping&quot;: &quot;&lt;optionales_mapping&gt;&quot;, &quot;command&quot;:
&quot;&lt;command&gt;&quot;, &quot;argv&quot;: [&lt;list of arguments as array&gt;]}

It basicly runs the denoted command with the arguments (for the future
we can think about adding variables, that are replaced on a call)

The command is called by gobject.spawn_async, so we don't have to worry
about it in our adress space

/LBRC/UinputDispatcher.py
=========================
This modules takes the keys, mousebuttons, mousewheel, mouseaxes entries
in profiles and is responsible to create the uinput device, and issue
the correct event sequenze for each type.

Currently there is no way to create compound keys like STRG+C. This has
to be added to the parser. The parser currently only handles single key
strokes... but the infrastructure to handle that is in place, we just
need a nice way to configure it.

/LBRCdbus.py
============
Creates a dbusinterface instance and issues the mainloop (not more, not
less)

/LBRCgui (aka LBRC.py)
======================
Was renamed, as LBRC.py prevented a system installation, because we got
a import loop. Here currently (I want to split it out) the gui part is
handled. Basicly this part starts a new LBRCdbus.py instance (if it
didn't find the service on the bus and the service is not issued via
dbus activation -- we have to get rid of this -- it's error prone!!!)
and communicates with the dbusinterface to give status information,
allow profileswitching ...

I hope that helped a bit to get through the code

Mfg

Matthias
