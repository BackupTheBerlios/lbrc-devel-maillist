<PRE>Hey,

first the bad news: Currently LBRC is pretty useless on 64bit machines.
There are several reasons for this, but all are rooted in the uinput
structure. The locations off the ioctl differ, python is not able to
invoke these calls, because of a bug in the fnctl module and it would
need a kernel patch to work. This is caused by the structures, that are
send from userspace, that have to be in the same alignments and sizes,
as the kernel structures. Someone forgot to implement compat routines.
(see: <A HREF="http://www.keshi.org/moin/moin.cgi/PS3/WiiRemote">http://www.keshi.org/moin/moin.cgi/PS3/WiiRemote</A>)

So what I aim to do is introducing a new adapter written in C, that only
does two things:
      * listen on dbus to inject keyevents into the kernel
      * create uinputdevs on request via dbus and call the appropriate
        ioctls

Marc mentioned this problem and he already got a small C programm and
that works as expected. My next step would be to implement the dbus
listening part. This means: Users will need to compile this part for
their system, or we have to provide binaries for all plattforms.

But this part would have the benefit to solve the problem also for other
projects like the wiimote.

The good news: 

      * The internationalisation thinggy seems to be easier, as
        expected. The first translation (de) is in SVN and new
        translations are easily integratable - I'm waiting for Iuri and
        the profile editor, because I think there we will be faced with
        a much bigger number of strings, that need translation
      * profile switching is no longer blocked, the UInputDispatcher now
        tears down all remaining actions on set_profile (removing the
        name stupid switch_profile call, that basicly just checked,
        whether we can switch)
      * Compound keys (CTRL+C) work now and are parsed correctly (no
        support for longer keysequences though)

So as announced I will have a look at the bluetooth connection
(discoverable switching) this week.

I'm not sure how far I will get with respect to the dbus&lt;-&gt;uinput
bridge, as I'm not entirely sure if it advisable to stay with the basis
dbus parts or it would be good to use the glib bindings for it, as in my
opinion this part should be as small as possible and as big as necessary
(the signature should include the initialisation done currently in
__init__ in UinputDispatcher, and what send_event does).


Greetings

Matthias
