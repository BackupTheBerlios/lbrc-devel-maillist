<PRE>Hello,

I had a look at the GUI configuration system as I wanted to update it
with the new modules ... Well I haven't done anything yet.

I want to get away from the per Module Lists towards an interface, that
is centered around the display of a typical mobile, where the user can
map keys to actions. The relevant module sections will be created on
that basis. So far so nice I think.

But then -- json is all nice and shiny, but for an config file, I would
like to be able to put comments into the file -- sure I can comment an
json file, but the comments will be lost, when the file is first time
parsed and changed in LBRC. And I'm not to happy how the internal
configuration is handled currently. Gconf with it's notification system
for changes would be really nice -- but then this would add a hard
dependency on gconf. Would anyone here place a veto?

Alternativly I would consider switching to XML and using the DOM as the
main interface to the config. Then making use of inotify/dnotify on the
linux platform would lead to similar results. An DOM approach would
enable as to keep comments (they are just leafs in the tree) and they
would survive the parsing.

I have not yet thought about a potential DTD - I'm not sure whether to
consider the module to be integral parts of LBRC, than there would be
the possibility to take the internal structure of each module into
account - or to consider modules to be very exchangeable, than there
would be the need for a generic DTD.

And I finaly I think, that keeping an XML document correctly formated is
much easier, than json. Before the change to the json serializer, I
considered it imposible to manual do changes to the personal json
config.

Suggestions or opionions with respect to the config system? What do you
think?

Greetings

Matthias
