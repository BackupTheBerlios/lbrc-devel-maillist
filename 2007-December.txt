My name is Felix. I've tried to install LBRC and with the application
that runs on the phone I've been successfull, but not with the part that
runs on my computer. The error message I get when I try to
run ./LBRCdbus.py is:

Do you know what this means? Any help would be appreciated, 'cause I
need your application to work in order to manage slideshows with it.

Thank you very much.

It's me another time. I've solved the problems I had running LBRC as
root user, but I can't run it as a regular user yet. What should I do to
do it?

Thanks!!!!!

Hi,

The uinput device (I think it is usually located ad /dev/input/uinput) must
have read and write permissions for the user. You can do it with the chmod
command, but the comfortable way is doing it at boot time. I'm not at my
linux box at the moment, but it depends on your dev filesystem manager (in
my case its udev).

I hope it solves your problem!

Subject: [Lbrc-devel] [Announce] LBRC 0.5
Message-ID: <1198706047.26346.11.camel@prometheus.glx>

Greetings,

finally after more than half a year I announce the 0.5 version of LBRC.
There were some very deep changes, that are reflected in this short
summary taken from the changelog (the svn log is quite a bit longer):

    * handle non-existing config more gracefully (was a crasher)
    * MPlayer allows to select files and play them
    * add a module to aid presentation control (stopwatch and log
      of duration of slides)
    * make CommanExecutor more robust
    * add --debug to dbus backend and to the frontend
    * better compatibility with bluetooth socket implementations
    * add visual feed back to VolumeContol Applet
    * move VolumeControl to gstreamer (should enable easy control of 
      OSS and Pulseaudio)
    * switch to a simpler and more clearly licensed JSON Parser

This also means, that some personal configs won't work anymore - you
have to test yourself.

These are the things I will try to get done for the next release:

      * Add gui for yet missing config of volumecontrol plugins
      * Add module to show arbitrary name=>value pairs (I'm thinking
        about using this to provide feedback for music control)

Other things I try to work on:
      * Get the package into debian (there seems to be the problem of
        the missing free wtk, not sure how fast this can be resolved) --
        but this would enable the use on nearly every platform, as
        currently the dbus-uinput bridge has to be rebuild on each
        platform
      * improve documentation (I would really appreciate help there -- a
        howto or getting started guide would really help -- I will
        primarily have a look at the modules)
      * Get bugs out of existing modules and complete feature set (for
        ex. OSS+Pulseaudio for VolumeControl)

So I wish you a happy new year!

Matthias

Hello again,

if you notice a delay, between connection the phone and being able to do
something useful, then you hit a python-bluetooth bug. It is caused by
the name lookup for a device running into a timeout.

This was easily fixed by switching to the bluez dbus api to do the job.
So if your facing this problem either apply the attached patch or
checkout svn-trunk. I'll try to fix some more problems, do some of the
improvements I announced and get another version out in the middle of
January.

Greetings

Matthias
