Hello there,

I now own a K810i from Sony. And now I tried to run LBRC and - well - I
learnt, that the j2me implementation is just brain dead.

Let me explain: I can open bluetooth connections, but can only use them
to output data, but not receive. This would be all nice, if I had denied
the programm access to the bluetooth apis, but I allowed access.

It seems, that the application has to be signed to access, this secure
apis ... Well ... Well ... All I found regarding this situation seems to
indicate, that it gets expensive to get a certificate.

So until I find a solution, no further development will happen from my
side.

Mfg

Matthias

PS: This implementation of j2me is just broken - my 2 cents.

Hello there,

Just for your information there is a similar project to LBRC:
http://code.google.com/p/amora/ (I haven't tested it yet, since LBRC
is working fine for me)

Subject: [Lbrc-devel] Update: found the bug,
 repaired and conforming to	documented api (Future of LBRC)

Hello all,

ok - My last email was a bit to fast send. I had another look and finaly
found the bug in a final keyword, that the k810i does not seem to like.
Well now the behaviour should conform more to the documented api.

At the end of November I think I will find the time to do another
release. I will also have a closer look on amora and the protocol they
use. There a two very interesting things in it at a first glance:

     1. Being able to take screenshots (the LBRC Protocol can be
        extended to do that - actually it's just taking the shoot, do
        some escaping, to be able to stuff it into json and write a j2me
        counterpart to display it)
     2. Using XTest for Keyboard and Mouse Control. Here I'm not sure
        whether I like that - but then choice is good and maybe there
        will be a second Plugin for Keyboard/Mousecontrol.

LBRC differs especially because there is a j2me client (a python version
should be pretty easy doable).

So far

Matthias
