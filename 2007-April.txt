Subject: [Lbrc-devel] Release when?
Message-ID: <1176323073.29183.4.camel@debian.glx>

Hello all,

I think judging from the long list of changes that were done in the
core, I would like to get a release out of the door, before more
extensions (like widgets for the phone) are introduced.

I would like to ask you where you see places that have to be worked on
before a release. I think the gui should get a high priority or the
decision not include the editor into the release. Are there remaining
errors/problems in the basic system that have to be fixed?

As far as I can say the AMD64 Problem should be fixed since the switch
over to the dbus<->uinput bridge. Anything more?

Greetings

Matthias

Hello,

I asked for opinions towards a new release. I tried to work on the GUI
part and was partly successfull (read: The UinputDispatcher Config part
is working). I would like to encourage you to test it.

Please Iuri, what is your opinion on this. I started this work, because
you did not react to my last email - I did not mean to offend you.

Greetings

Matthias
