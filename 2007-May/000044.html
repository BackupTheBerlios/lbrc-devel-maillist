<PRE>Hello Lars,

There are no stupid questions, just stupid answers!

&gt;<i> Why is lbrc implementing its own protocol instead of writing a HID
</I>&gt;<i> client running on mobile phones? The advantage of HID would be that it
</I>&gt;<i> would look like a regular bluetooth keyboard/mouse to the computer.
</I>&gt;<i> Since HID is implemented in all modern OSes, you wouldn't need an
</I>&gt;<i> extra application running on the PC.
</I>
Actually when I started this project I had absolutely no idea what is
necessary to implement a service like this. The basic motivation was a
Mac Programm, that a professor at universaty used to control his
notebook. Half a year later I was reminded by a blog entry where a
skeleton for a simple remote control was partitally implemented.

This was the start - the first idea was to just throw the keycodes from
the phone to the pc and that was it. With the resent protocal change the
foundation for a bi-directional communication was laid (currently the
modules can request a list selection and react to the selection).

And (something I really begin to like) there is the possibility to use
different profile concurrently. The 0.4 version will be put out with
modules to control applications via DBUS, has a mplayer module, can
execute arbitrary commands and also offers Keyboard/Mouse Control.

So I have one profile, with which I can control the mouse, then I switch
to the Rhythmbox profile, adjust music and swithc back to mouse control.
I like this greater flexibility.

&gt;<i> ..or is the reason that JSR82 doesn't expose the required
</I>&gt;<i> functionality to implement a HID device?
</I>
I really don't know! But the JSR82/J2ME implementers seem to be a bit
lazy when it comes to completeness and more exotic functionality seems
to be missing quite often.
