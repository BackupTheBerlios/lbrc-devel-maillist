Subject: [Lbrc-devel] Release when?
In-Reply-To: <1177792793.20913.4.camel@prometheus.glx>

Hallo again,

here is what I see as my TODO list before the release:

      * Change config format of MPlayer modules (seperating arguments
        and commands is pointless and only complicates the config -
        consider the DBUS Module the Worst-Case-Szenario)
      * After that add MPlayer Configurator
      * Add CommandExcecutor
      * Review the chaos I left behind and clean up
      * try to break LBRC and fix potential problems

SO PLEASE: Test it - the Version in SVN works for me and should also
work for you

Good night,

Matthias

Ok,

the MPlayer and CommandExecutor Modules were easier than expected. So we
stand were I would like to get Bugs and Regressions fixed.

Marc already reported a problem of LBRC, where the new version does not
work correctly. Marc - could you provide me with the Model and
Manufactor of your phone? A shallow search on the web showed, that Nokia
et. all. were pretty lazy when implementing the specification...

Greetings

Matthias

PS: As already stated in my last SVN commit, I declare trunk feature
complete for next release - we're in bug fixing phase.

Subject: [Lbrc-devel] Release of 0.4
Message-ID: <1178744246.30338.6.camel@prometheus.glx>

Hello all,

today I did some tests and did some small clean ups, that caught some
more errors, updated the build system, tried a system install, built a
debian package for i386.

I want to get a wider testbase (Marc - did you find time to test the
j2me client again?). So I will release tomorrow or friday - If no one
sets a block.

Mfg

Matthias

Subject: [Lbrc-devel] Generic Bluetooth HID?
Message-ID: <d776779b0705110521p55ee92e9mc7dc03a2784707f3@mail.gmail.com>

This is probably a stupid question, but..

Why is lbrc implementing its own protocol instead of writing a HID
client running on mobile phones? The advantage of HID would be that it
would look like a regular bluetooth keyboard/mouse to the computer.
Since HID is implemented in all modern OSes, you wouldn't need an
extra application running on the PC.

..or is the reason that JSR82 doesn't expose the required
functionality to implement a HID device?

There are no stupid questions, just stupid answers!

Actually when I started this project I had absolutely no idea what is
necessary to implement a service like this. The basic motivation was a
Mac Programm, that a professor at universaty used to control his
notebook. Half a year later I was reminded by a blog entry where a
skeleton for a simple remote control was partitally implemented.

This was the start - the first idea was to just throw the keycodes from
the phone to the pc and that was it. With the resent protocal change the
foundation for a bi-directional communication was laid (currently the
modules can request a list selection and react to the selection).

And (something I really begin to like) there is the possibility to use
different profile concurrently. The 0.4 version will be put out with
modules to control applications via DBUS, has a mplayer module, can
execute arbitrary commands and also offers Keyboard/Mouse Control.

So I have one profile, with which I can control the mouse, then I switch
to the Rhythmbox profile, adjust music and swithc back to mouse control.
I like this greater flexibility.

I really don't know! But the JSR82/J2ME implementers seem to be a bit
lazy when it comes to completeness and more exotic functionality seems
to be missing quite often.

Ah, that's a very good point. Hmm, perhaps you should have a talk with
the lirc developers.

After some googling..

It looks like JSR82 only allows PSM values above 0x1000. All the
standard services like HID are below 0x1000 so looks like J2ME can't
be used for this.

PSM is, as far as I understand, the bluetooth equivalent of TCP port
numbers. So this would be like trying to implement a mail server in
Java, but your Java TCP/IP stack only allowing you to listen to ports
above 1024.

Oh well, seems I have to figure out how to write a native app for
Nokia S60. Thanks for your help.

You should look into the python-bluez bindings - they seem to be
compiled for the wrong python version. Is arch linux compiled from
source, then you should rebuild and if there are prebuild packages, than
you should inform the maintainer.

And you need the json module. In debian the module is names python-json,
not sure what it is called on arch linux.

Hope that helps
