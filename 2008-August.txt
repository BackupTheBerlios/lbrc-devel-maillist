Subject: [Lbrc-devel] N80 internet edition firmware
Message-ID: <4284163a0808020232x6fe0328bi1f6448734678b078@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Does LBRC works with N80 internet edition? With an older firmware It
worked but after upgrading my mobile firmware I have the following
problem:

LBRCdbus --debug:

LBRC.BTServer                      : DEBUG    Trying to register service:

...this is only the initilaziation of LBRC. I think I can't connect to
LBRC because whilst connecting it doesn't say anything.

I've tried it with an up-to-date ubuntu (Hardy) and with an Ubuntu
(Hardy) Live CD (without updates)
I've tried the SVN version of LBRC as well.
I'll try other live CD-s to be sure it is because of the mobile
firmware upgrade.


Thanks!
Peter

Hey,

please check, whether the service announcement makes it into the system
sdp server. The sdpserver is responsible for the publishing of the
services provided by the bluetooth adapter. You can get the list like
this:

mblaesing at enterprise:~$ sdptool browse local

There should be an entry like this:

Service Name: LBRC
Service RecHandle: 0x10004
Protocol Descriptor List:
  "L2CAP" (0x0100)
  "RFCOMM" (0x0003)
    Channel: 1

If it is not listed, something is fishy in the bluez stack (on the linux
side), if it is listed we have to take a look at the phone.

Greetings

Matthias

So long and thanks for all the fish!

Hey again,

actually this is a shot into the dark - I changed the search parameters
(based on other UUIDs). Could you please fetch this build:

http://www.doppel-helix.eu/LBRC.jar
http://www.doppel-helix.eu/LBRC.jad

And try again. Maybe the S60 exposes the search routines differently...

Greetings

Matthias

ok - I broadend the attribute list to search and narrowed the UUIDs to
accept (this should work!).

So could you please grab the latest release from

http://www.doppel-helix.eu/LBRC.jar
http://www.doppel-helix.eu/LBRC.jad

It should help

Matthias

Hi!

Nothing has changed :(.
I'll try to downgrade my phone's firmware to be sure the problem is
with the new firmware.
Anyway thanks that you are dealing with it.

Hi again

Downgrade is not possible on the N series phones so I can't try it.
Hope there will be a solution in the near future.

Thanks
Peter

another try ...

I changed the profile we advertise again, this time it announces, that
we use the serial port profile. As my bluetooth receiver announces the
same profile I have some hope to get around the potential "security
measures" of the manufactor.

So - what do you have to do?

1. Grab another build of the j2me client from the usual location
(http://www.doppel-helix.eu/LBRC.ja*)
2. Change BTServer.py: 

def __init__(self, name = "LBRC", serverid = "9c6c8dce-9545-11dc-a3c1-0011d8388a56"):

has to be changed to:

def __init__(self, name = "LBRC", serverid = "0x1101"):

There is little more, that I could imagine that could go wrong ....

HTH

Hi

Now the error message (after waiting about 15 seconds) is : "Service
serch error"

Thanks!

I really have no idea where to search next. What you could try (if you
have a gps receiver handy):

http://www.qcontinuum.org/gpstrack/

Check whether that works. It uses basicly the same search parameters and
if that works, some more suspicious is going on.

Sorry ... I think there was some problem with my bluez stack, so the
error message is simply the same: "LBRC Service not found ..." NOT the
"Service serch error"
I've just tried and gpstrack is working with my bluetooth GPS device
I'll try a few things (hard resetting my phone, etc.)
Hope something will happen.


Thanks anyway.

And another round. I had a closer look at the gpstrack code and it so
very, very close. The basic difference I can see is handling of errors
in the service search (there is none in gpstrack). So what I did is: We
still check the response code and error messages are created. (This is
intended to be used with the modification to BTServer.py described in
the last email)

Nevertheless we iterate the found services list - maybe the service was
found despite another response code (I'm just doing some wild guessing -
but debugging is a bit hard without a connection ...)

Good night

Matthias

Hello,

I've fetched it from http://www.doppel-helix.eu/LBRC.jar
Still the same error message.
Do you know anybody who got it working with an N80 Internet edition firmware?
Something really strange is happening here.

Cheers!

Sure - you give the key to be pressed together seperated by a "+" sign.
For example LEFTALT+TAB yields a change of windows. For you this should
be:

LEFTMETA+B (this would be left windows key and b pressed together)
RIGHTMETA+B (this would be right windows key and b pressed together)
COMPOSE+B (this would be menu key and b pressed together)

I don't know whether the keybindings are case sensitive, but to generate
a uppercase b try this: LEFTMETA+LEFTSHIFT+B

Message-ID: <1219002018.21097.23.camel@enterprise.glx>

Hey,

as you can see, the mailinglist works again. Berlios has fixed the
issue. In the meantime there were some bugs hunt down and I'm happy to
announce, that I added Jasper to the developer group. He did not only
fix some lingering unpleasenties in the logging framework and did some
janitorial work, but he also created a PPA for ubuntu users.

I currently have a look at a way to create a nice gtk cell renderer for
the new XInput Module. I'm not yet sure who to do this, but as a side
effect I was able to unify the CellCommandArgumentsRenderer and the
CellDBUSArgumentsRenderer by introducing a new base class, that contains
most of the code of the two.

Have a look at the svn log.

Greetings

Matthias

I just added a new build of the j2me client, that was build with an

Hi everybody,

Quick introduction: 24/m/NL/engineering student, learning Python since
this spring, no java ME knowledge (yet), Ubuntu user, Nokia 3110c phone,
 learned debian packaging last week to package lbrc on my ppa. :)

So, as Matthias said I did a bit of janitorial work, but the main reason
I wanted to get involved is because using lbrc and peeking at the
code/config gave me a few ideas on how lbrc may be improved and more
ready for Joe Average users (in my opinion).

Most importantly, I think the logic of the configs is currently the
wrong way around. A user would like two things:
1. That pressing num key 7 on his phone is registered as num key 7
2. That he can set the action num key 7 will perform.
To elaborate on that: Currently settings involve the keycodes. A user
will have a hard time translating '42' to a specific key on his phone. I
would like to suggest that on the pc, there is a mapping function that
takes key codes and outputs a descriptive string like 'NUM7', 'LEFT',
'SOFTLEFT' 'NUM*' , 'CENTER', etc. Internally, lbrc would only use these
descriptive strings to map actions to. E.g. the .lbrc.conf only has
these descriptive names to map actions to, the applet config window
could feature a dropdown list with all possible descriptive strings.
Now, not all phones have the same keycode to real key mapping. That's
why, on discovery of a new BT address, LBRC-applet should popup a window
that notifies the user that a new phone has been detected. The user
should be able to select from a list of preconfigured mappings which
features as much phones as possible and in that same window should also
have the option to create a new mapping. If that window also features a
little area where recorded key presses are presented in descriptive
strings, the user can directly check whether the selected mapping is
correct. The selected mapping or custom mapping should be saved to
.lbrc.conf.

Now for point 2. I would like to suggest a 3 level system:
- Profiles
- Schemes
- Handlers
First Handlers. These objects are the InputCaller, CmdCaller,
DBusCaller. They should be kept really basic and simple. For example,
the CmdCaller only knows how to call 1 command (with argument list) and
the InputCaller only knows how to handle 1 (combination)keypress or 1
mousemovement/click at the time (but with configurable repeat time).

Now comes the new part. Schemes are lists of Actions that belong to a
certain program/use case. For example, a Rhythmbox Scheme. This scheme
consists of a list of actions and each action is defined as 1 or more
Handler calls. So say the Rhythmbox action 'Play' is defined as a dbus
call to the Rhythmbox dbus object with all the right parameters. Or for
example a MyPresentation scheme has an action 'Start movie 1' which is a
CmdCall for mplayer with as argument the path to a specific movie.
Now the real nice thing would be, schemes are configurations so they
should be saved and loaded from .lbrc.conf. And even better, make
importing/exporting schemes from the configuration possible. I want to
be able to download this nifty Scheme somebody created with 30 possible
options to handle Program X and load that into my LBRC-applet to use to
create...

A custom profile! A profile in my opinion is the 1 on 1 mapping of
descriptive key strings to Scheme Actions, but also directly to Handler
calls. So for example, I may have a 'My Presentation' profile. In the
profile manager, I have 1 window in which I can define keys. So I click
the dropdown box, select 'NUM7'. To the right of that dropdown box, I
click the dropdown box which gives me a selection between 'Desktop,
Rhythmbox, My Presentation actions, MPlayer, Home automation, Key press,
Mouse, Command, DBUs'. See how I am able to select both Schemes and
Handlers here? Than, depending on my selection in this dropdown box I
get usually a new dropdown box to the right. Say I picked 'My
Presentation actions'. In the new dropdown box I can now pick 'Next
slide', 'Play movie 1', 'Black screen', 'Full screen'.
Again, this is all pure configuration so this can be saved, imported and
exported in/to/from .lbrc.conf.

In other words, the current four tabs should go. A user wants to work
from keys -> action. Similary, the .lbrc.conf profiles should be a
key->scheme/handler->action/command flow.



Next, on the mobile side:
The current slide helper screen and volume screen are nice, but I think
what would be really nice is have a profile dependent overview of the
button mappings visible. I can't remember what NUM7 does in profile Foo!
The profile list can be send over, how about sending a profile
description on choosing one? What I'm thinking of is:
- The J2ME app should have a set of stock icons, can be very simple,
even wingdings like images for 'play, pause, stop, volume up, volume
down, shutdown, etc.
- On choosing a profile, the pc sends a description which contains
something like 'NUM7{ico:play}, NUM8{txt:'FFWD'}'. Now, the J2ME program
doesn't have to know which keycode goes with that NUM7. It just needs to
draw a generic phone key layout on screen, with a play icon in the
square that represents NUM7 and the string 'FFWD' in the square
representing NUM8.
My phone does svg, I'm not sure how normal that is nowadays but if it is
normal, it would be very easy to scale vector buttons, vector images and
text to the exact size of the screen.
When you want the presentation helper widget, you might use 2/3 of the
screen with room for the timer above and the slide number on the side!
Same for the volume helper screen, scale down the key mapping view a
little and draw the bars in the created space.
When people create a profile or scheme, one of the options in the editor
could be how to present the action on the phone. So give the ability to
choose between text (max 4 chars) and icons with again a dropdown list
of the icons also present on the phone.


Ok, this was basically what caused me to not sleep almost an entire
night last week because I was so excited about coming up with this
design which would improve the usability of the program (in my opinion).
It's a lot of text and likely I left some stuff out that is present in
my head so that this makes perfect sense for me but not (yet) for you
guys. So please, let me know what you think.

Finally, a few notes:
- LBRC-applet and LBRCdbus are the only /usr/bin executables on my
system with CAPS. It looks kind of wrong and against convention. Maybe
make that more in line with the rest of the unix world an go lowercase?
- The ganyremote J2ME program knows how to save previously used
connections. So scanning for devices becomes an option, you can pick
your system from a list. That would be nice for lbrc too.


Sincere,
Jasper

Hey,

Man! That is a list - I'm not sure whether I can reply in depth, as I'm

pretty similar.

You can support both. If you get a number from json, its a keycode, if
not its an alias. But it would be better IMHO, if the config keeps to
keycodes, as these are not dependend on an interpretation.

Actually there is currently handler and profiles, the current term
profile would in your wording be schemes, and you would add another
layer on top.

What you are suggesting is done now through the predefined profiles,
which can be copied into a new profile an adjust the used keys and
functions.

So you want to create an aditional abstraction layer? I'm reluctant to
do this. Consider the rhythmbox profile. Currently this is just a thin
wrapper around the dbus caller module. For me this is nice. Another,
maybe better module would be a player module, that supports xmms,
rhythmbox, amarok, ... transparently and from one place.

?hm - the current config gui is a pretty direct translation of
the .lbrc.conf structure. Each module is represented by a tab, each
profile in the drop down menu.

Hava look at the MIDP 2 spec. I'm not sure about svg, but at these
screen sizes, I think using indexed png would be equally good. But
someone would have to implement that and I would not wan't to have the
keys always visible (I'm thinking something like a help screen).

The screen is a moving target in the MIDP environment (the sizes differ
from phone to phone).

Your opening a can of worms!

I think we should have another look, who it already might just need the
right gui, without reinventing the whole layering.

Not sure where you store X, but programms starting with X contradict
your theses:

mblaesing at enterprise:~$ X<tab>
X         Xdmx      Xephyr    XMLRPCsh  Xorg      
mblaesing at enterprise:~$ X

I'm reluctant to change the name. Joe average user will probably just
use the GUI icon.

This would be doable - I have to check whether we need our own handling
of this or whether we can just reuse the infrastructre from j2me. This
is definitly something archivable pretty easily.

These are some comments - I'll try to find some more time to look
through it again, but I think the main focus should be to improve the
config _gui_, fix some quirks of the modules and improve the j2me part.

Supporting both ok, but IMHO it would make more sense to use the
aliases. There is a higher chance all phones having NUM7 compared to
having keycode 42.

I agree it is close to how it is now. I guess the difference comes from
my notion that the first choice a user makes shouldn't be which handler
to use (e.g. which tab to choose). For example, if I now open the config
window and pick Rhythmbox, I see nothing. I first have to switch to the
DBuscaller tab.

> So you want to create an aditional abstraction layer? I'm reluctant to

Two arguments to do add abstraction here:
1. Ability to give names like 'Play' and 'Pause' to the actions instead
exposing the full DBus call
2. Ability to predefine more actions than keys available.
Yes, you would have to have a Rhythmbox profile and a Rhythmbox scheme.
The Rhythmbox profile is only 42:(Rhythmbox, 'play') (or
'NUM7':(Rhythmbox, 'play') ) and the Rythmbox scheme would have
'play':(DBuscaller, org.gnome.Rhythmbox, /org/gnome/Rhy.. etc).

Say I now want to create a custom profile with mostly Rhythmbox actions
but replace two keys with Desktop volume up and volume down. This would
be done by creating a new profile and picking Rhythmbox as the basis
profile. I look in the list of keys -> Scheme:action, change the scheme
for the right key to the 'Desktop' scheme and pick 'Volume up' from the
list with 30 actions defined for the Desktop scheme. If however, I want
to create a brand new action I don't pick a Scheme but one of the base
handlers from the dropdown list. This would replace the Action dropdown
list with the widget for that Handler to define it.

> For me this is nice. Another,

I think the only way to handle different players would be emulating
keyboard multimedia keys

Correct. And I think a direct translation between config file and gui is
indeed something to aim for. So that would mean a change in .lbrc.conf.

Since it would involve sending data from the applet, there could be an
option in the applet to toggle showing the keys on phone screen.
Or put the option in the phone, but it doesn't have a option menu yet so
maybe that would be even more work.
svg is jsr 226: http://wiki.svg.org/index.php?title=JSR_226

The nice thing is that you can first build up a button in say 100x100
pixels and than put it on the canvas in a size defined as
1/3*screenwidth. So even though screens come in all shapes and sizes,
this way you can work around that.

Ah, isn't user interaction always juggling cans of worms? :)

I didn't expect anything else, just wanted to state my opinion. :)

Thanks for taking the effort commenting.

Ok - to do exaktly this, you would have to introduce a record store.
Instead I decided to stick with what the bluetooth stack offers us
already. You can query the discovery agent for a list of preknown
devices (on my phone this list is the same as under "Meine Ger?te" (My
devices"). I asume that on most phones this will be a list of paired
devices. As per Default LBRC requires the phone and the device to be
paired, after the first connection the notebook should be part of the
list.

If you want to test ist, have a look at the svn code and build yourself
or grab your copy from http://www.doppel-helix.eu/LBRC.ja[dr]

Hi,

Firs, the new build from doppel-helix.eu fails on my nokia 3110c with
'Exception in Deviceselect: java.lang.NullPointerException'.
The pc is in the coupled devices list and active. The connection works
the other way since I used BT to send the new version of the ja{r|d} file.

That's where a phone brand based key mapping profile would come in,
which a user could pick on connecting a phone for the first time to the
applet.
A different option that just popped in my head, could be adding the
feature that when a user selects the keycode input widget, a press of a
phone key would fill that keycode in the input widget.

Ah, this brings me to an issue with the current design: Currently, a key
press/release is registered and all event handlers are polled to see if
they map this keycode in the active profile. This allows for
flexibility, I guess this way 1 keypress could mean 'left mouse button'
'Rhythmbox.play' and 'Walk the dog' at the same time, but in my opinion
1 keypress should in principle be mapped to one action. Note that it is
still possible to create an action that consists of a set of calls/input
events.
And a scheme which describes actions should, in my vision, be a
configuration file. I don't know if this is truly feasible, but I
envision only the basic input, dbus and command call modules left over.
All elaborate actions should be definable in basic module commands.

You could still define arbitrary dbus calls by picking the dbus module
in the scheme list. I wouldn't want to remove that powerful feature.
Only make it an advanced feature that a power user would use.

If all players are so different in how they can be controlled, what
would be the gain of 1 generic player module? The first option a user
must set in the generic player would be which player program he/she
actually wants to use the player module with and then the player module
would have a lot of if/elif/else structs to handle 'play' for all the
different modules. And say if a user wants to add support for player
Foo, he has to work through all these if/else structs to add the
specific commands for this player, send the patch to you, get it
applied, packaged, etc.
I hope that it is possible to make the scheme support such that you can
copy/import/export schemes like you do profiles. Adding an extra scheme
for player Foo would be much easier in that case.

Hmm, I don't have much experience with either json or xml, but I like
how 'clean' json markup looks compared to the clunky <xml> tags.
Allowing comments would be nice, yes. But since you have made your
custom json parser any way, adding support for comments in there would
be also possible. No?

Yeah keeping compatibility has high as possible should be the first choice.

I was to careless... Instead of just returning an empty RemoteDevices
Arrray, the function return null, if now devices are preknown. Don't
know who had this bright idea, but now that btdevices is checked to be
non null it should work. (Put a build up)

That is in your case, you would be greeted with an empty list.

You get inflexible this way. Think about the presentation module. There
are many actions when pressing the next slide key: restart the slide
timer, save the record for the last slide and switch to next slide.

The handling of the slide timer and records is pretty easy (one module
and your done), but there are n+1 programms to show presentations, each
with slithly different keybindings. Why make it unnecessry complex and
just provide a way to send request via dbus, keyinput and so on.

I see the point for the end user. But the multiple programms can easily
tangled by providing pre created profiles f?r acroread, evince, OOo
Impress and so on. This coupled with a new config inteface shoudl do
it. 

What I think of is this:

Make the tabs in the profile section "Init", "Actions", "Destruct" or
their corresponding title for "normal" people. Inside these you find a
treeview, with keycode (on the phone, if you want also with Alias Names)
and the associated actions. The actions are short text desciptions and a
double click opens a window, where you can configure the action. Action
in this case means a combination of handler and config for it.

This frontend config can be decomposed to the already known config
format. And the current config format can be put into the format
described above. By treeview reordering you could sort by handler,
key/keycode and paramters (this would be stupid).

I tried to do a GUI Mockup - I thing it shows my idea. If a screen
designer wants to step up to improve I have no problem with that.

I like your mockup, it is actually close to what I had in mind, so I
created my own mockup to show you what I actually have in mind. :)

What is not done yet is the new 'Actions' tab. I envision that as a
Treeview with 4 columns:
[Action name] [Handler] [Detail] [Cellphone action]
With:
Action name: The unique identifier of a certain action, used in the
profile tab to select the action from the (alphabetically sorted) list
of all actions combobox.

Handler: The event handler used for the action. E.g. XInput, DBus, etc.
Or, if the action consists of multiple events, it should say 'Multiple
events'. Only on double clicking the action (which opens the action edit
window) you see the list of event handlers and the details such as which
key pressed, what dbus command called, etc.

Detail: If action == multiple events again show 'Multiple events', else
show the details as explained above

Cellphone action: A list of signals that can be send to cell phone. As a
start these would be 'Presenter:Next slide', 'Presenter:Previous slide',
 'Presenter:Reset', 'Volume:Update'.

If a cell phone action is set, the applet should first check whether the
right cell phone view is set in the current profile to handle the
signal. If not, just ignore the cell phone signal. (E.g. if I have a
profile 'Presenter' and set the cell phone view to 'Normal', don't try
to signal 'Presenter:Next slide' to the phone if an action has that signal).

Hey,

so I try to summarise:

This is the current situation:

profile -> {keycode->handler/parameter}

A profile is a mapping between a keycode and an associated
handler/parameter.

Your Idea sounds like this:

profile -> {keycode->action}

and

action -> [handler/paramater]

A profile is a mapping between keycode and associated action and an
action is a mapped to one or more handler/paramters.

I'm thinking about the situation where a whole keyboard gets mapped. The
actionslist is then least 52 entries long. With action names like
"keypress_a" or "keypress_A". Not really helpfull.

I see benefits, if you define actions based on the dbus and
commandexecutor module. The example was for a media player. But then a
mediaplayer might want to keep an internal state or needs more work
under the hood (like the mplayer module). If you go that far you can
create a generic Player module, which specific player is set at profile
selection and that "knows" how to handle each player. This is currently
done in the VolumeControl Module, that has currently support for alsa
and oss (pulseaudio needs work, as there are no channels, but instead
each sind is identified as a device on a server).

Greetings

Matthias

He he, in that way it would not be very helpfull no. But, it does have
the advantage that you can map the action once and reuse multiple times
in the profile. But I see the problem now that if there are 52 keypress
actions + 10 MPlayer actions + 6 evince actions + 8 OOimpress actions,
etc, the list to scroll to find the right action to map becomes very
very long. So perhaps it does have to be a 3 column list for Profile:
profile -> {keycode->actionset->action}
where actionset is a list of actions that belong together. E.g.:
- a Keypress actionset with 52 actions (not much benefit there compared
to bare handler/parameter setting)
- a MPlayer actionset with actions Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Prev, etc
which would be less frightening to Joe compared to the bare
handler/parameter list.

The action tab in this case would be a top row similar to the profile
top row (dropdown list + 3 buttons [new, edit, delete]) but with action
sets and the bulk of the action tab would be very similar to what the
profile tab currently is, but instead of the first column being keycode
it could be handler to eliminate the current inner tabs. The action set
wouldn't need 'on start'/'on stop' event definitions I think.

Hey again,

these are both bad examples. The mplayer Module is currently a thin
wrapper around the mplayer remote control syntax (Have a look at
"mplayer -input cmdlist"). This is as easy as it can get.

We already have a place where "knowing" people can create compounds and
new modules. These places are the modules. From a module you have the
full power of python at your finger tips. If the config is really that
difficult, you should hide it alltogether.

This leaves complex dbus calls and complex commandlines to the action
list. And these could also be summarised in a module (Lets call it
'Little helpers at your fingertips'.

Thinking again about this, you could add a comment field and shortname
for each action, which could provide Joe-Normal-User a hit whats going
on. Add in an "Action library" from which you can copy'n'past or
drag'n'drop and you're there. The library contains predefined handler
calls with the above mentioned comments and shortnames. Additionally you
can create a hierarchy and so on. But there is no connection between
library and the handlers, after the copying the action, it is part of
the profile and can be modified seperately.

What do you think of the last part? Actually this email was started to
be written three days ago, and today was the last part done.

Greetings

Matthias
