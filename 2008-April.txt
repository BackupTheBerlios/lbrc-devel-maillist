Hi !

I'm trying to start lbrcdbus but it dosn't start and I got this output:

Please check your bluez setup. It looks as if your SDP Server (this
makes the lbrc and other bluetooth services visible to other devices)
does not like the infos fed into it from lbrc.

Maybe I can give better info, if you state the version of your bluez
package and which distribution and which version you use.

Greetings

Matthias

This could indicate problems in the xml parser of hcid or in the xml
generator of lbrc, but if this is really a problem in the generator I
can't see why.

To debug this please open BTServer.py and replace line 224:

            self.advertise_id = self.bluez_db.AddServiceRecordFromXML(service_record)

with:

            self.logger.debug('Trying to register service: %s' % service_record)
            self.advertise_id = self.bluez_db.AddServiceRecordFromXML(service_record)

Then run: LBRCdbus --debug

This will print the XML used to register the service in the hcid.

Two things not so directly related to finding the real problem:

1. Why in hell don't you use the distribution packets?! I can't imagine,
that there are no precompiled packages for SuSE.

2. Please keep lbrc-devel at lists.berlios.de always CCed - it may not look
so, but there are people reading and helping and another benefit: The
problems and their solutions are archived.

Greetings

Matthias

Hey Alexander,

thanks for your mail and input. I write this email just to inform the
lbrc-devel list about your mail. I'm busy right now, so there is the
best forum to discuss. I would like to ask you to direct further info
directly there, as I read there but there are other, that can
potentially help or give feedback. Oh - and the discussions are
archived ;-)

Greetings

Matthias

Hey,

I'll try to comment on some of your points. Please see below.

I commented the whole lowercase section and fixed this -- please see
further down (fixed in SVN trunk).

Let me guess -- your using a non-english keyboard layout? The two
problems are caused by the input layer -- this just generates keycodes
and these codes are mapped to symbols. This mapping is locale dependend.
So my keyboard (german) maps the symbol z to code 29. An english
keyboard would map y to 29. And lbrc only generates the codes, not the
symbol.

This also explains the problem of a-z working, but A-Z not working. When
you generate an uppercase letter with a keyboard not an uppercase
letter/code is send, but this:

1. keycode of (left/right) shift (down)
2. keycode of lowercase character (down)
3. keycode of lowercase character (up)
4. keycode of (left/right) shift (up)

While the lowercase letter is generated by the 2+3 events. So in LBRC
you would have to specify LEFTSHIFT+A to get an uppercase a.

I think the gui should offer a way to record the wanted keycodes in the
"right" locale. So if anyone wants to implement it - feels free to do
so!


I hope that cleared the situation a bit and thanks for the input

Matthias
