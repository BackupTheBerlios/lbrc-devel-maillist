</I>Supporting both ok, but IMHO it would make more sense to use the
aliases. There is a higher chance all phones having NUM7 compared to
having keycode 42.

&gt;<i> What you are suggesting is done now through the predefined profiles,
</I>&gt;<i> which can be copied into a new profile an adjust the used keys and
</I>&gt;<i> functions.
</I>I agree it is close to how it is now. I guess the difference comes from
my notion that the first choice a user makes shouldn't be which handler
to use (e.g. which tab to choose). For example, if I now open the config
window and pick Rhythmbox, I see nothing. I first have to switch to the
DBuscaller tab.

&gt;<i> So you want to create an aditional abstraction layer? I'm reluctant to
</I>&gt;<i> do this. Consider the rhythmbox profile. Currently this is just a thin
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper around the dbus caller module.
</I>Two arguments to do add abstraction here:
1. Ability to give names like 'Play' and 'Pause' to the actions instead
exposing the full DBus call
2. Ability to predefine more actions than keys available.
Yes, you would have to have a Rhythmbox profile and a Rhythmbox scheme.
The Rhythmbox profile is only 42:(Rhythmbox, 'play') (or
'NUM7':(Rhythmbox, 'play') ) and the Rythmbox scheme would have
'play':(DBuscaller, org.gnome.Rhythmbox, /org/gnome/Rhy.. etc).

Say I now want to create a custom profile with mostly Rhythmbox actions
but replace two keys with Desktop volume up and volume down. This would
be done by creating a new profile and picking Rhythmbox as the basis
profile. I look in the list of keys -&gt; Scheme:action, change the scheme
for the right key to the 'Desktop' scheme and pick 'Volume up' from the
list with 30 actions defined for the Desktop scheme. If however, I want
to create a brand new action I don't pick a Scheme but one of the base
handlers from the dropdown list. This would replace the Action dropdown
list with the widget for that Handler to define it.

&gt;<i> For me this is nice. Another,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe better module would be a player module, that supports xmms,
</I>&gt;<i> rhythmbox, amarok, ... transparently and from one place.
</I>I think the only way to handle different players would be emulating
keyboard multimedia keys

&gt;<i> &#196;hm - the current config gui is a pretty direct translation of
</I>&gt;<i> the .lbrc.conf structure. Each module is represented by a tab, each
</I>&gt;<i> profile in the drop down menu.
</I>Correct. And I think a direct translation between config file and gui is
indeed something to aim for. So that would mean a change in .lbrc.conf.

&gt;<i> Hava look at the MIDP 2 spec. I'm not sure about svg, but at these
</I>&gt;<i> screen sizes, I think using indexed png would be equally good. But
</I>&gt;<i> someone would have to implement that and I would not wan't to have the
</I>&gt;<i> keys always visible (I'm thinking something like a help screen).
</I>
Since it would involve sending data from the applet, there could be an
option in the applet to toggle showing the keys on phone screen.
Or put the option in the phone, but it doesn't have a option menu yet so
maybe that would be even more work.
svg is jsr 226: <A HREF="http://wiki.svg.org/index.php?title=JSR_226">http://wiki.svg.org/index.php?title=JSR_226</A>
on java.com: <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/javame/technology/msa/jsr226.jsp">http://java.sun.com/javame/technology/msa/jsr226.jsp</A>

&gt;<i> The screen is a moving target in the MIDP environment (the sizes differ
</I>&gt;<i> from phone to phone).
</I>The nice thing is that you can first build up a button in say 100x100
pixels and than put it on the canvas in a size defined as
1/3*screenwidth. So even though screens come in all shapes and sizes,
this way you can work around that.

&gt;&gt;<i> When people create a profile or scheme, one of the options in the editor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be how to present the action on the phone. So give the ability to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choose between text (max 4 chars) and icons with again a dropdown list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the icons also present on the phone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your opening a can of worms!
</I>Ah, isn't user interaction always juggling cans of worms? :)

&gt;<i> I'm reluctant to change the name. Joe average user will probably just
</I>&gt;<i> use the GUI icon.
</I>I didn't expect anything else, just wanted to state my opinion. :)

Thanks for taking the effort commenting.

Regards,

Jasper
