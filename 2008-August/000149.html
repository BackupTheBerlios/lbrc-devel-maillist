<PRE>Hi everybody,

Quick introduction: 24/m/NL/engineering student, learning Python since
this spring, no java ME knowledge (yet), Ubuntu user, Nokia 3110c phone,
 learned debian packaging last week to package lbrc on my ppa. :)

So, as Matthias said I did a bit of janitorial work, but the main reason
I wanted to get involved is because using lbrc and peeking at the
code/config gave me a few ideas on how lbrc may be improved and more
ready for Joe Average users (in my opinion).

Most importantly, I think the logic of the configs is currently the
wrong way around. A user would like two things:
1. That pressing num key 7 on his phone is registered as num key 7
2. That he can set the action num key 7 will perform.
To elaborate on that: Currently settings involve the keycodes. A user
will have a hard time translating '42' to a specific key on his phone. I
would like to suggest that on the pc, there is a mapping function that
takes key codes and outputs a descriptive string like 'NUM7', 'LEFT',
'SOFTLEFT' 'NUM*' , 'CENTER', etc. Internally, lbrc would only use these
descriptive strings to map actions to. E.g. the .lbrc.conf only has
these descriptive names to map actions to, the applet config window
could feature a dropdown list with all possible descriptive strings.
Now, not all phones have the same keycode to real key mapping. That's
why, on discovery of a new BT address, LBRC-applet should popup a window
that notifies the user that a new phone has been detected. The user
should be able to select from a list of preconfigured mappings which
features as much phones as possible and in that same window should also
have the option to create a new mapping. If that window also features a
little area where recorded key presses are presented in descriptive
strings, the user can directly check whether the selected mapping is
correct. The selected mapping or custom mapping should be saved to
.lbrc.conf.

Now for point 2. I would like to suggest a 3 level system:
- Profiles
- Schemes
- Handlers
First Handlers. These objects are the InputCaller, CmdCaller,
DBusCaller. They should be kept really basic and simple. For example,
the CmdCaller only knows how to call 1 command (with argument list) and
the InputCaller only knows how to handle 1 (combination)keypress or 1
mousemovement/click at the time (but with configurable repeat time).

Now comes the new part. Schemes are lists of Actions that belong to a
certain program/use case. For example, a Rhythmbox Scheme. This scheme
consists of a list of actions and each action is defined as 1 or more
Handler calls. So say the Rhythmbox action 'Play' is defined as a dbus
call to the Rhythmbox dbus object with all the right parameters. Or for
example a MyPresentation scheme has an action 'Start movie 1' which is a
CmdCall for mplayer with as argument the path to a specific movie.
Now the real nice thing would be, schemes are configurations so they
should be saved and loaded from .lbrc.conf. And even better, make
importing/exporting schemes from the configuration possible. I want to
be able to download this nifty Scheme somebody created with 30 possible
options to handle Program X and load that into my LBRC-applet to use to
create...

A custom profile! A profile in my opinion is the 1 on 1 mapping of
descriptive key strings to Scheme Actions, but also directly to Handler
calls. So for example, I may have a 'My Presentation' profile. In the
profile manager, I have 1 window in which I can define keys. So I click
the dropdown box, select 'NUM7'. To the right of that dropdown box, I
click the dropdown box which gives me a selection between 'Desktop,
Rhythmbox, My Presentation actions, MPlayer, Home automation, Key press,
Mouse, Command, DBUs'. See how I am able to select both Schemes and
Handlers here? Than, depending on my selection in this dropdown box I
get usually a new dropdown box to the right. Say I picked 'My
Presentation actions'. In the new dropdown box I can now pick 'Next
slide', 'Play movie 1', 'Black screen', 'Full screen'.
Again, this is all pure configuration so this can be saved, imported and
exported in/to/from .lbrc.conf.

In other words, the current four tabs should go. A user wants to work
from keys -&gt; action. Similary, the .lbrc.conf profiles should be a
key-&gt;scheme/handler-&gt;action/command flow.



Next, on the mobile side:
The current slide helper screen and volume screen are nice, but I think
what would be really nice is have a profile dependent overview of the
button mappings visible. I can't remember what NUM7 does in profile Foo!
The profile list can be send over, how about sending a profile
description on choosing one? What I'm thinking of is:
- The J2ME app should have a set of stock icons, can be very simple,
even wingdings like images for 'play, pause, stop, volume up, volume
down, shutdown, etc.
- On choosing a profile, the pc sends a description which contains
something like 'NUM7{ico:play}, NUM8{txt:'FFWD'}'. Now, the J2ME program
doesn't have to know which keycode goes with that NUM7. It just needs to
draw a generic phone key layout on screen, with a play icon in the
square that represents NUM7 and the string 'FFWD' in the square
representing NUM8.
My phone does svg, I'm not sure how normal that is nowadays but if it is
normal, it would be very easy to scale vector buttons, vector images and
text to the exact size of the screen.
When you want the presentation helper widget, you might use 2/3 of the
screen with room for the timer above and the slide number on the side!
Same for the volume helper screen, scale down the key mapping view a
little and draw the bars in the created space.
When people create a profile or scheme, one of the options in the editor
could be how to present the action on the phone. So give the ability to
choose between text (max 4 chars) and icons with again a dropdown list
of the icons also present on the phone.


Ok, this was basically what caused me to not sleep almost an entire
night last week because I was so excited about coming up with this
design which would improve the usability of the program (in my opinion).
It's a lot of text and likely I left some stuff out that is present in
my head so that this makes perfect sense for me but not (yet) for you
guys. So please, let me know what you think.

Finally, a few notes:
- LBRC-applet and LBRCdbus are the only /usr/bin executables on my
system with CAPS. It looks kind of wrong and against convention. Maybe
make that more in line with the rest of the unix world an go lowercase?
- The ganyremote J2ME program knows how to save previously used
connections. So scanning for devices becomes an option, you can pick
your system from a list. That would be nice for lbrc too.


Sincere,
Jasper
