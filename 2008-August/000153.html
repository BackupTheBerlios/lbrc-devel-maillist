<PRE>Hi,

Firs, the new build from doppel-helix.eu fails on my nokia 3110c with
'Exception in Deviceselect: java.lang.NullPointerException'.
The pc is in the coupled devices list and active. The connection works
the other way since I used BT to send the new version of the ja{r|d} file.

&gt;<i> Actually the only high chance to have a match is only in the range of
</I>&gt;<i> NUM0-NUM9, STAR and POUNT. These are the standard keys on _all_ mobiles.
</I>That's where a phone brand based key mapping profile would come in,
which a user could pick on connecting a phone for the first time to the
applet.
A different option that just popped in my head, could be adding the
feature that when a user selects the keycode input widget, a press of a
phone key would fill that keycode in the input widget.

&gt;<i> This basicly exists. A Scheme is just a more intelligent module. Let's
</I>&gt;<i> go back to the Player example. Currently the Rhythmbox Profile uses the
</I>&gt;<i> DBUS-Module. But it does not have to. You could also programm a
</I>&gt;<i> Rhythmbox Module, that hides the whole DBUS handling and just offers:
</I>&gt;<i> play, forward and so on.
</I>Ah, this brings me to an issue with the current design: Currently, a key
press/release is registered and all event handlers are polled to see if
they map this keycode in the active profile. This allows for
flexibility, I guess this way 1 keypress could mean 'left mouse button'
'Rhythmbox.play' and 'Walk the dog' at the same time, but in my opinion
1 keypress should in principle be mapped to one action. Note that it is
still possible to create an action that consists of a set of calls/input
events.
And a scheme which describes actions should, in my vision, be a
configuration file. I don't know if this is truly feasible, but I
envision only the basic input, dbus and command call modules left over.
All elaborate actions should be definable in basic module commands.


&gt;<i> I just widend the  scope, as such a module shoudl then handle more than
</I>&gt;<i> only player. What technique is used in the backend is not important. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact there are things that could be better done with a real Rhythmbox
</I>&gt;<i> (or Player) module, than it is done now. Please consider the Rhythmbox
</I>&gt;<i> Profile a proof of concept (Being able to do arbitrary dbus calls is
</I>&gt;<i> quite powerful and I would want to miss it).
</I>
You could still define arbitrary dbus calls by picking the dbus module
in the scheme list. I wouldn't want to remove that powerful feature.
Only make it an advanced feature that a power user would use.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For me this is nice. Another,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> maybe better module would be a player module, that supports xmms,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rhythmbox, amarok, ... transparently and from one place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the only way to handle different players would be emulating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keyboard multimedia keys
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope! You sure have to do some more work, but most players offer some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of remote control feature (via named pipe, a tcp/unix socket, a
</I>&gt;<i> dbus api or dcop) and as this is a mess, I should be put into a seperate
</I>&gt;<i> module, so that the user does not see the difference.
</I>
If all players are so different in how they can be controlled, what
would be the gain of 1 generic player module? The first option a user
must set in the generic player would be which player program he/she
actually wants to use the player module with and then the player module
would have a lot of if/elif/else structs to handle 'play' for all the
different modules. And say if a user wants to add support for player
Foo, he has to work through all these if/else structs to add the
specific commands for this player, send the patch to you, get it
applied, packaged, etc.
I hope that it is possible to make the scheme support such that you can
copy/import/export schemes like you do profiles. Adding an extra scheme
for player Foo would be much easier in that case.


&gt;<i> We will need a good reason to do that - because then, I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> switch also away from json towards something more readable like XML
</I>&gt;<i> (this would also allow comments in .lbrc.conf).
</I>
Hmm, I don't have much experience with either json or xml, but I like
how 'clean' json markup looks compared to the clunky &lt;xml&gt; tags.
Allowing comments would be nice, yes. But since you have made your
custom json parser any way, adding support for comments in there would
be also possible. No?


&gt;<i> The svg.org site does not offer a good compatibility scaling, but in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion we shoudl try to keep inside MIDP-2.
</I>
Yeah keeping compatibility has high as possible should be the first choice.

&gt;<i> PS: Maybe we should try to get a time to meet in IRC or a Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> channel? We could then get some topics better discusses as via email -
</I>&gt;<i> or we should break the emails into smaller parts.

I'll try logging in Thursday night.
