<PRE>Hey,

Man! That is a list - I'm not sure whether I can reply in depth, as I'm
pretty occupied, but some things were pretty interesting and some seemed
pretty similar.

&gt;<i> [Introduce aliases for the keycodes]
</I>
You can support both. If you get a number from json, its a keycode, if
not its an alias. But it would be better IMHO, if the config keeps to
keycodes, as these are not dependend on an interpretation.

&gt;<i> [New level system for config]
</I>&gt;<i> Now for point 2. I would like to suggest a 3 level system:
</I>&gt;<i> - Profiles
</I>&gt;<i> - Schemes
</I>&gt;<i> - Handlers
</I>
Actually there is currently handler and profiles, the current term
profile would in your wording be schemes, and you would add another
layer on top.

What you are suggesting is done now through the predefined profiles,
which can be copied into a new profile an adjust the used keys and
functions.

&gt;<i> First Handlers. These objects are the InputCaller, CmdCaller,
</I>&gt;<i> DBusCaller. They should be kept really basic and simple. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> the CmdCaller only knows how to call 1 command (with argument list) and
</I>&gt;<i> the InputCaller only knows how to handle 1 (combination)keypress or 1
</I>&gt;<i> mousemovement/click at the time (but with configurable repeat time).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now comes the new part. Schemes are lists of Actions that belong to a
</I>&gt;<i> certain program/use case. For example, a Rhythmbox Scheme. This scheme
</I>&gt;<i> consists of a list of actions and each action is defined as 1 or more
</I>&gt;<i> Handler calls. So say the Rhythmbox action 'Play' is defined as a dbus
</I>&gt;<i> call to the Rhythmbox dbus object with all the right parameters. Or for
</I>&gt;<i> example a MyPresentation scheme has an action 'Start movie 1' which is a
</I>&gt;<i> CmdCall for mplayer with as argument the path to a specific movie.
</I>&gt;<i> Now the real nice thing would be, schemes are configurations so they
</I>&gt;<i> should be saved and loaded from .lbrc.conf. And even better, make
</I>&gt;<i> importing/exporting schemes from the configuration possible. I want to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to download this nifty Scheme somebody created with 30 possible
</I>&gt;<i> options to handle Program X and load that into my LBRC-applet to use to
</I>&gt;<i> create...
</I>
So you want to create an aditional abstraction layer? I'm reluctant to
do this. Consider the rhythmbox profile. Currently this is just a thin
wrapper around the dbus caller module. For me this is nice. Another,
maybe better module would be a player module, that supports xmms,
rhythmbox, amarok, ... transparently and from one place.

&gt;<i> In other words, the current four tabs should go. A user wants to work
</I>&gt;<i> from keys -&gt; action. Similary, the .lbrc.conf profiles should be a
</I>&gt;<i> key-&gt;scheme/handler-&gt;action/command flow.
</I>
&#196;hm - the current config gui is a pretty direct translation of
the .lbrc.conf structure. Each module is represented by a tab, each
profile in the drop down menu.

&gt;<i> Next, on the mobile side:
</I>&gt;<i> The current slide helper screen and volume screen are nice, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> what would be really nice is have a profile dependent overview of the
</I>&gt;<i> button mappings visible. I can't remember what NUM7 does in profile Foo!
</I>&gt;<i> The profile list can be send over, how about sending a profile
</I>&gt;<i> description on choosing one? What I'm thinking of is:
</I>&gt;<i> - The J2ME app should have a set of stock icons, can be very simple,
</I>&gt;<i> even wingdings like images for 'play, pause, stop, volume up, volume
</I>&gt;<i> down, shutdown, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> - On choosing a profile, the pc sends a description which contains
</I>&gt;<i> something like 'NUM7{ico:play}, NUM8{txt:'FFWD'}'. Now, the J2ME program
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have to know which keycode goes with that NUM7. It just needs to
</I>&gt;<i> draw a generic phone key layout on screen, with a play icon in the
</I>&gt;<i> square that represents NUM7 and the string 'FFWD' in the square
</I>&gt;<i> representing NUM8.
</I>&gt;<i> My phone does svg, I'm not sure how normal that is nowadays but if it is
</I>&gt;<i> normal, it would be very easy to scale vector buttons, vector images and
</I>&gt;<i> text to the exact size of the screen.
</I>
Hava look at the MIDP 2 spec. I'm not sure about svg, but at these
screen sizes, I think using indexed png would be equally good. But
someone would have to implement that and I would not wan't to have the
keys always visible (I'm thinking something like a help screen).

&gt;<i> When you want the presentation helper widget, you might use 2/3 of the
</I>&gt;<i> screen with room for the timer above and the slide number on the side!
</I>&gt;<i> Same for the volume helper screen, scale down the key mapping view a
</I>&gt;<i> little and draw the bars in the created space.
</I>
The screen is a moving target in the MIDP environment (the sizes differ
from phone to phone).

&gt;<i> When people create a profile or scheme, one of the options in the editor
</I>&gt;<i> could be how to present the action on the phone. So give the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> choose between text (max 4 chars) and icons with again a dropdown list
</I>&gt;<i> of the icons also present on the phone.
</I>
Your opening a can of worms!

&gt;<i> Ok, this was basically what caused me to not sleep almost an entire
</I>&gt;<i> night last week because I was so excited about coming up with this
</I>&gt;<i> design which would improve the usability of the program (in my opinion).
</I>&gt;<i> It's a lot of text and likely I left some stuff out that is present in
</I>&gt;<i> my head so that this makes perfect sense for me but not (yet) for you
</I>&gt;<i> guys. So please, let me know what you think.
</I>
I think we should have another look, who it already might just need the
right gui, without reinventing the whole layering.

&gt;<i> Finally, a few notes:
</I>&gt;<i> - LBRC-applet and LBRCdbus are the only /usr/bin executables on my
</I>&gt;<i> system with CAPS. It looks kind of wrong and against convention. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> make that more in line with the rest of the unix world an go lowercase?
</I>
Not sure where you store X, but programms starting with X contradict
your theses:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lbrc-devel">mblaesing at enterprise</A>:~$ X&lt;tab&gt;
X         Xdmx      Xephyr    XMLRPCsh  Xorg      
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/lbrc-devel">mblaesing at enterprise</A>:~$ X

I'm reluctant to change the name. Joe average user will probably just
use the GUI icon.

&gt;<i> - The ganyremote J2ME program knows how to save previously used
</I>&gt;<i> connections. So scanning for devices becomes an option, you can pick
</I>&gt;<i> your system from a list. That would be nice for lbrc too.
</I>
This would be doable - I have to check whether we need our own handling
of this or whether we can just reuse the infrastructre from j2me. This
is definitly something archivable pretty easily.

These are some comments - I'll try to find some more time to look
through it again, but I think the main focus should be to improve the
config _gui_, fix some quirks of the modules and improve the j2me part.


Greetings

Matthias
